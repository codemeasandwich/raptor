# Context-Auto 

### React App State Management

## How it Works

`context-auto` is a state management library for React applications. It simplifies state management by utilizing the Context API and allows you to define and manage state across your application with ease.

### Setup

1. Import the `StateProvider` from the `context-auto` library at the top level of your app's entry file:

```javascript
import { StateProvider } from "context-auto";
```

2. Wrap your entire application within the `StateProvider` component at the top level of your component hierarchy. This makes the state available to all components in your app:

```javascript
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <StateProvider>
      {/* ... YOUR APP CODE */}
    </StateProvider>
  );
};
```

### State Initialization

In each folder of your application, you must have an `index.js` file. This file will be called with no arguments the first time the application loads to populate the default properties of that entry in the state.

Optionally, you can also have an `init.js` file in the same folder. This file can return a promise to perform any asynchronous tasks needed for initializing the application.

### Handling State Updates

There are two types of files that can be presented to the system:

1. **Synchronous Files:** These files must export a single default function.

2. **Asynchronous Files:** These files must export four functions: `action`, `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`. The `action` function serves as the entry point.

   Here are the signatures for each of these functions:

   - `pending(posts, payload)`: Called when an asynchronous action is pending.
   - `fulfilled(posts, payload, serverPosts)`: Called when an asynchronous action is successfully fulfilled.
   - `rejected(posts, payload, error)`: Called when an asynchronous action is rejected or encounters an error.
   - `action(payload)`: The main function that should be called to initiate an action. It must return either a promise or `undefined` if the asynchronous action is to be cancelled immediately.

### Technical Insights

This state management library utilizes the React Context API to share references of ES modules and reads your app's folder structure via Webpack. It simplifies state management by providing a structured way to define and manage your application's state, making it easier to maintain and scale your React application.
